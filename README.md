# Doubly Linked List Implementation in TypeScript

## Overview

This project is a TypeScript implementation of a doubly linked list, designed to be robust and easy to use. It supports efficient insertion and deletion of elements at both ends, and allows traversal in both directions. The API is similar to JavaScript arrays, making it familiar and straightforward to use.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Designed to be user-friendly with an API similar to JavaScript arrays.
- **TypeScript Support**: Provides type safety and IntelliSense support for improved development experience.
- **Bidirectional Traversal**: Allows traversal from both the head and the tail of the list.
- **Dynamic Size**: Supports dynamic addition and removal of elements.
- **Flexible Insertion and Deletion**: Allows insertion and deletion of elements at both the beginning and the end of the list.
